    Snake is an old game consisting of moving around with your snake trying to eat as many apples
    as possible. With each apple eaten, the snake gets longer. However, if you collide into yourself,
    it’s game over. Furthermore, you can play a two player version but you can’t kill the other snake.
    Also make sure that your window is the correct size so you don’t scroll around when controlling
    the snake.

    Pacman is a single player game, where the player controls Pac-Man, a yellow circle with a moving mouth,
    who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. The score box shows your current score, and the game is won if you eat all the dots. 
    Eating large flashing dots called "Power Pellets" causes the ghosts to temporarily turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.
